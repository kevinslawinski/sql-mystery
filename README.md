Inspired by @veltman's command-line mystery, use SQL to research clues and find out whodunnit!<br>
[SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) | [on GitHub](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries)

To get started...
- Have an existing instance of SQL Server running.
- Download the .sql files in the project (or copy the repo)
- Open `Start_Here_SQLMurderMystery.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (you'll know what to do next!)

This was built and tested on `Microsoft SQL Server 2022` using `SQL Server Management Studio 19.3`
