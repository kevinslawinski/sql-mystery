# SQL Mystery
Based on: [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/) | [on GitHub](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) <br>
_Use SQL to research clues and find out whodunnit!_ <br>

To get started...
- Have an existing instance of SQL Server running.
- Download the .sql files in the project (or copy the repo)
- Open `Start_Here_SQLMurderMystery.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio
- You'll see what to do from there!<br>
  Remember, no peeking at `solution.sql` early :wink:

This was built and tested on `Microsoft SQL Server 2022` using `SQL Server Management Studio 19.3`
